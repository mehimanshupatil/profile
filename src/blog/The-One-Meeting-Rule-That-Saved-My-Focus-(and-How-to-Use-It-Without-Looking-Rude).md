If your calendar looks like a patchwork quilt and you get a ping every time someone has an idea, you're not alone. For the last two years I tracked how much uninterrupted engineering time I actually had—and the answer was depressing: less than two hours on a good day. Then I introduced a single, non-negotiable meeting rule. It didn’t make me popular overnight, but it did buy back my most valuable resource: attention.

The meeting rule (short version)
- Meeting rule: Accept a meeting only if the invite clearly includes (1) a concise agenda, (2) your role in the meeting (what’s expected of you), and (3) a clear desired outcome or decision to be made.

I call it the 3C meeting rule—agenda, contribution, and closure. If one of those is missing, the default is “no”—or at least “not yet.”

Why this simple filter works
- It forces organisers to think before they schedule: writing a two-line agenda often reveals that the problem can be solved in chat or an async doc.
- It protects your flow: knowing the meeting will have a clear outcome makes it worth the context switch.
- It reduces filler meetings: many invites are status updates that could be an email or a shared note.

How I apply the rule in practice (scripts you can reuse)
- If the invite lacks the three items, I reply with a short, low-friction message:
  - “Can you add a 1–2 line agenda, what you need from me, and the decision expected? I’ll block time if it needs my input.”
- If the organiser is a manager or a client and I can’t refuse, I propose an alternative:
  - “Happy to join for 15 minutes if we can stick to decisions. Otherwise I can review notes and provide async feedback by EOD.”

These messages work in India’s mixed meeting culture—where invites can come both from Outlook and WhatsApp—because they’re practical, not confrontational.

When to break the rule
- Emergencies: production incidents, escalations, or genuinely time-sensitive client issues.
- Onboarding or mentoring: sometimes showing up helps a team member more than a perfectly run meeting.
- Occasional context-building: for a new cross-team initiative, initial conversations benefit from synchronous discussion.

Tradeoffs and real downsides
- Perception cost: being strict about meetings can be mistaken for aloofness, especially in hierarchies where face time matters. I had a manager interpret my declines as disinterest once—until I documented the work I did with the reclaimed time.
- Missed context: skipping a meeting means you might not hear side conversations or body language that matter. I mitigate this by asking for a quick 2–3 line summary if I don’t attend.
- Friction for others: some colleagues aren’t used to writing agendas. Expect an initial ramp-up where you spend time coaching people to follow the rule.

Tactics to enforce the rule compassionately
- Block deep-work slots: make 90–120 minute blocks visible as “Focus – Do Not Book” and treat them as sacred. Most teams will adapt when they see consistent patterns.
- Keep a meeting buffer: allow a 15-minute buffer between meetings—this prevents back-to-back context switching and gives you time to prepare or write quick follow-ups.
- Offer async alternatives: create a short template (problem, proposed options, ask) that people can paste into Slack or email. When your teammates see that async works, they use it.
- Coach with examples: when you decline, suggest the exact wording the organiser can use to re-send the invite. People need guardrails, not just refusals.

India-specific notes that shaped how I use the rule
- WhatsApp invites: informal group pings frequently lead to quick-schedule calls. I ask for an email or calendar invite with the 3C items even for casual calls.
- Time zones and overlap: for teams spread across India and overseas, insisting on a clear outcome helps justify inconvenient time slots.
- Client relationships: for freelance or client work, I use a softer approach—ask for a short pre-read and limit meetings to 30 minutes unless the outcome needs more.

A quick, practical playbook to try this week
1. Pick one week and block two 90-minute focus slots daily.
2. Send a one-line team note: “Trying a meeting rule: I’ll only join invites with agenda + expected contribution + decision. Happy to review async.”
3. Use the decline script the first few times—be consistent.
4. Track at week’s end what you shipped or completed during reclaimed time.

Real results I saw
- My weekly deep work rose from ~6 hours to ~15 hours.
- Fewer status updates, more decision-focused meetings.
- An initial pushback from a couple of stakeholders, which faded once the quality of my deliverables improved.

Final caveat
This isn’t a silver bullet. The meeting rule shifts how work happens—it won’t fix broken processes or teams that rely on synchronous hand-holding. You’ll need to pair it with clear async practices and, sometimes, patient coaching.

If you try it, don’t promote it like a crusade. Treat it as an experiment: share the wins, be flexible for real needs, and help your team adopt the tiny habits (short agendas, pre-reads, clear asks) that make fewer meetings actually work better. It’s saved me hours, and more importantly, the ability to do deep, thoughtful work again—something every developer in India’s fast-moving companies should fight to protect.
